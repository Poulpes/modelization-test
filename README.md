## Instructions

Try to draw a minimal relational database schema that would capture the the Businness / Product brief. Don't spend too much time on detailed columns, the idea is to focus on:
- required tables/models and their naming
- relations between tables
- important columns

Ideally, you would take about 1 hour to draft something and you're free to use any database diagram tool, google slides or paper and pencils.
